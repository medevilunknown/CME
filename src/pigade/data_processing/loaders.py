    Loads data from a CDF (Common Data Format) file into a pandas DataFrame.

    This function is a placeholder for loading Aditya-L1 SWIS-ASPEX data.
    It assumes that the CDF file contains time-series data where each variable
    is a record in the file.

        file_path: The path to the CDF file.

    Returns:
        A pandas DataFrame containing the data from the CDF file,

        Returns an empty DataFrame if the file cannot be loaded.
